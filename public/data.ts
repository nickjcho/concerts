  concert_notes: [
    "Very good live vocals! I didn't exactly go in to the concert expecting top-tier vocals but I was pleasantly surprised at how stable she was despite being sick",
    "We were seated in the balcony, which seemed nice at first until she started walking around the floor area while performing. I felt some intense FOMO from that",
    "The concept film that played in between the concert acts was very atmospheric. I thought her acting was really good, not surprising as I know she did debut as an actress and won a bunch of awards for it already lol"
